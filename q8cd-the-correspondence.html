Correspondence theory is a traditional model which goes back at least to some of the ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined solely by how it relates to a reality; that is, by whether it accurately describes that reality. If, for any reason, a student cannot continue full-time studies, the student may continue through correspondence courses, evening courses, remote study or external study.

Feel free to also recommend other good basic topics. I actually need to buy a ship for my Ambition: Light Fingers and this was apart of it. Took me months, yikes. Well I’m gonna celebrate. So in taking my first steps for SMEN, I decided to grind my Scholar ranking so I can immediately forget about it. I'm at level 8 rn, and I was told writing symphonies is a good way to get it to 10. But is it me or does it raise veeeerrrrryyyyy slllloooooowwwwwllllyyyy? Like is this all I can do, or is there a more quick way of doing. I really really need Renown:Devils for my Nemesis Ambition, but I'm really enjoying my time studying the Correspondence, and I want to keep doing it. Can I still study without my stones? Can I get more? Should I just pursue the other ways of getting renown/favours. The story is set in a customer service call centre for a free to play mobile game, strange and sinister things happen to both the customers and staff over the course of the series, I believe it even had the bard commenting on it. Like I said in the title it's very similar in tone and writing style to The Correspondence, it's quality writing. Any help would be much appreciated. So, we have recently found an expression for the general state vectors +ngt and -ngt to be: +ngt = cos(θ/2) +zgt + sin(θ/2)e^iφ -zgt -ngt = sin(θ/2) +zgt - cos(θ/2)e^iφ -zgt But, when solving problems that involve some Stern-Gerlach devise oriented at certain polar angles θ amp φ in R^3, we can somehow say that these are the same angles found in our Hilbert space spin state vector. How does this pair of angles correspond across vector spaces 
Like the world that a claim corresponding to is just the sum of our ontology, thus claims can only be true if they make some claim about that ontology (I hope that makes sense). I have a question for nosleep members, does anyone know the name of a series about workers at a call centre for a free to play mobile game? its from around 2016 if I remember rightly. Strange and sinister things start to happen to both the workers and customers and its quite similar to The Correspondence in style and tone, I believe some of the series even had the bard commenting on it but I don't think it was actually written by u/bloodstains (https://www.reddit.com/u/bloodstains) unless. So, Jeremy Irons plays a. famous astrophysics professor! That's right up there with the movie trend to have their male protagonist be "an architect" And he's married with kids, but, he ALSO has --- a hot Russian/Slavic girlfriend Who happens to be a PhD candidate for theoretical physics and astrophysics, herself She is as well as an actress in action movies, in her spare time, to earn a few extra dollars here and there And she spends a lot of the rest of her time in high-end art galleries. 1st people to to come up with the highest % of similarities, idk how to explain. </p>
